## Command Line ProSet

[Projective Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_Set_(game)) is a fun Set-like game. 

This is the 7-Card version, and is made to be played in the terminal. Quality of life for UI is still in development. 
Download this, run `npm install` in the directory (for chalk) and run `node proset.js`.
